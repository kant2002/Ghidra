Ghidra
======

[![Build Status](https://codevision.visualstudio.com/Ghidra/_apis/build/status/kant2002.Ghidra?branchName=master)](https://codevision.visualstudio.com/Ghidra/_build/latest?definitionId=92&branchName=master)

**Ghidra provide build infrastrture now. This project no longer needed**

This is source code derived from Java code found in `XXX-src.zip` files shiped with Ghidra. I collect modification which community post in the issues to actual Ghidra, and just ship them here. Also I provide some simple fixes for silly issues when I able to make it.
Azure DevOps project now have built JAR files, and they should be usable with Ghidra. You could modify your Ghidra installation,
by replacing JAR files in the original Ghidra installation. Just click on Azure badge and download JAR from Artifacts button. Structure of the project is similar to what of Ghidra.

# How to build

Instructions pretty simple.

```
cd Ghidra
mvn package
```

There assumption that root of this repository is same as root of unpacked Ghidra distribution. This allow magic to happens. 
I need more time to put all supplementary code to the source control and generate proper build pipeline.

**CAUTION**
If you want to compile Ghidra using Gradle you have to wait a bit until RuntimeScripts module would be published. 
This is essentially command line scripts as far as I aware. Reason why do you need them, is that `support/LaunchSupport.jar`
perform detection of Development/Production environment based on the presence of `build.gradle` in the root folder. 

# Issues

- Runtime support scripts for launching Ghidra is missing

# Update processor manuals
To update all processor manuals run 

    bash ./tools/update-manuals.sh

See https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/38 for more information.

Compare built Ghidra with released version. In PowerShell only (could be Powershell Core on Linux)

    ./tools/compare.ps1 -GhidraLocation "C:\ghidra"
